Hi! I'm Sohang Chopra. I love to read, write and program - so I decided to combine writing
and programming by starting this blog! (I already read a lot - so that part's covered.)

I have a fair bit of knowledge about Front End Web Development (I did an internship at
[Blazar](blazarsol.com), a Website Creating company), and some backend knowledge as well
(I've used PHP and ASP.NET in hobby projects).

In my free time, I love to explore new programming languages - the wierder, the better!
Actually, that's not true - some of these amazing *new* programming languages are actually
quite old - Haskell (I love it!), Lisp (still exploring a few dialects, such as Racket and
Clojure) and APL (it's *very wierd* - but it promises to amaze, so I'm sticking with it).

Of course, I mostly use the boring (read: mainstream) languages - C++, Python, JavaScript.
Currently I'm mainly using C# at my internship at [Arcon](arconnet.com).
