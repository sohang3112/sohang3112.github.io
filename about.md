Hi! I'm Sohang Chopra. I love to read, write and program - so I decided to combine writing
and programming by starting this blog! (I already read a lot - so that part's covered.)

I nowadays work mostly in the intersection between backend web development and data science (including Machine Learning). I also know frontend web development, although I have used it less professionally. But really, I'm a generalist - rather than being confined to a single domain, I try to keep learning at least the basics of various other domains in the tech and software industry.

In my free time, I love to explore new tech and new programming languages - the more niche, the better!
Actually, that's not true - some of these amazing *new* programming languages are actually
quite old - Haskell (I ‚ù§Ô∏è it!), Lisp (still exploring a few dialects, such as Racket and
Clojure) and APL (it's *very strange* - but it promises to amaze, so I'm sticking with it).

Of course, I mostly use mainstream languages like C++, Python, JavaScript.
Currently I'm mainly using Python and AWS in my role as a Software Engineer at MFilterIt.

Do check out 
[my resume](https://sohang3112.github.io/resume/software_engineer.pdf) and
