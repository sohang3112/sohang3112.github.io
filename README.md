My blog website made with Github Pages and [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).

Likes & comments on blog posts are done via [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) (which is based on Github Discussions). Previously tried [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) since it supports signing up with Google, but could not debug the error [Disqus seems to be taking longer than usual](https://help.disqus.com/en/articles/1717300-troubleshooting-common-error-messages).

New Blog Posts are created by adding Markdown files in *_posts/* folder in format *YYYY-mm-dd-name.md*.
The date specified in post filename is then shown at the bottom of the post like *Written on March 10, 2024*.

## Local Development

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).


## SEO & Google Search Ranking

Currently my website seems not to be indexed at all - [my blog posts don't show at all in Google search results](https://github.com/sohang3112/sohang3112.github.io/issues/3). To fix this, I'm trying steps from [this guide](https://firstsiteguide.com/blog-not-showing-in-google/):
- [x] **Submit Sitemap:** Went to https://search.google.com/search-console/, uploaded page *google62f8e5f86bcb389e.html* to my site to verify ownership, and then submitted [my sitemap](https://sohang3112.github.io/sitemap.xml).
- [ ] **Build Quality Links** (see heading by this name in the above guide link)
