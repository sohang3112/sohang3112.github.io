# sohang3112.github.io (My website)

My blog website made with Github Pages and [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).

Likes & comments on blog posts are done using [Disqus](https://disqus.com/). Previously used [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) (which is based on Github Discussions), but shifted to Disqus since it supports signing up with Google which is easier for non-technical people.


## Local Development

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
