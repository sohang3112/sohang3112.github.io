## Publishing blog post

You can add additional posts in the browser on GitHub.com too! Just hit the + icon in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: *year-month-day-title.md*

Old template content in first post markdown:

> Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

> ![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

> The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
