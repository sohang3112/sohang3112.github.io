Normally I'm quite far from the world of video games. I consider myself a nerd, but unlike most nerds, I was never a big fan of playing video games. When I was a teenager, I had a couple of video games like Counter Strike and Dirt (car racing) in my PC - but they lay unused most of the time, only to be played when my younger cousin brothers came to my house on festivals. 

I have, however, always been more interested in the *process* of how video games are made. Although I haven't made any video game yet, I have tried to once when I was in school but ended up abandoning it.
But still, I would like to make and release at least one video game some time in the future - as a Software Engineer, I at least have the skills for game development, if not design.

Once, when I visited (with friends) a Video Game Fair in Delhi (capital of India), I was very interested in the various sights, sounds and experiences of so many free games around me, various of which I tried - to this day I regret that I didn't get the chance to play a VR (Virtual Reality) game which had quite a long line.

But anyway, now to come to the main topic: a while ago, I came across the book "Blood, Sweat and Pixels", which is a very fascinating glimpse inside the world of video game development. I'm not a video game player, but I'm a Software Engineer, so I was able to relate to many of the development aspects & difficulties. Especially the grind and unrealistic deadlines was relatable for me, as I have also sometimes had to work with tight deadlines, although thankfully much less than was portrayed in this book about Video Games' development.

> It’s a miracle that any game is made.
An annonymous game developer said this to the author (Jason Schreier), during one of his interviews with various insiders to understand what video game development is like. According to the author, this sentiment is common amongst all the people who have ever successfully built & sold a video game. Behind the scenes, every great video game is filled with funding getting suddenly cut, delays upon delays, developers forced to sacrifice most of their time for the sake of the game, etc.

But why is this true - why is video game development unique?? After all, software development is done in many other industries also, and while there are some delays, delays in video games are usually so huge that they are incomparable. The author suggests an answer to this quandary: **"Video games straddle the border between art and technology in a way that was barely possible just a few decades ago."** Considering that video game developers work at the forefront of both art (pushing the boundaries of interactivity with the player) and high perfomance software development (video games are resource intensive, so even sub-second performance improvements can improve players' perception of the game).

### Stardew Valley

In the book, the author talks about how many famous video games were developed. For me, one of the most memorable games I read in this book was **Stardew Valley** - because it was made full time by a solo developer Eric Barone!! To get an idea of how amazing this feat is, consider the fact that modern video games are typically developed by the effort of dozens (if not hundreds or even thousands) of people. Eric was largely inspired by the RPG game Harvest Moon (now known as Story of Seasons), which he used to play earlier and now set out to re-create its charm. *He initially set the target of finishing his game in six months - a target which turned out to be far too optimistic.* 

Eric's wife Amber supported him in his efforts. Eric was working on Stardew Valley full time with no other job, so his wife Amber had to earn

STRUCTURE
Intro - recently came across this book, I'm an SWE not a video game player, reflections on differences
"Miracle any game is made"
Why so hard - video games are at forefront of both art & tech
Stardew Valley -- made by solo developer
Diablo III -- recovery after disaster
mention other games
Conclusion - tip of iceberg, not possible without sacrifice, I'm an SWE not a video game player, reflections on differences

NOTES
-----

Pragati Maidan -- Video Game Fair

Pillars of Eternity -- (I think) first successful Kickstarter
    can tie Kickstarter to crowd funded fantasy novels of Brandon Sanderson
Stardew Valley -- made by one man!!!
Diablo III -- Recovery after disaster
Shovel Knight -- Kickstarter (not the first but stil a lot of challenges), self employed (first game)

"It’s a miracle that any game is made." - annonymous developer, in an interview to author, in book intro

" Video games straddle the border between art and technology in a way that was barely possible just a few decades ago." - author in intro

" One surefire way to annoy a game developer is to ask, in response to discovering his or her chosen career path, what it’s like to spend all day playing video games." - author in intro

"You might not tell your friends how excruciating the process was." - author in epilogue
    (i.e., People only see the tip of the iceberg and think game development is easy)

"Is there a way to make great video games without that sort of sacrifice? Is it possible to develop a game without putting in endless hours? Will there ever be a reliable formula for making games that allows for more predictable schedules?
         
For many industry observers, the answers to those questions are: no, no, and probably not."
   - author in epilogue

"In 2010, a Japanese company called Kairosoft released a mobile phone game called Game Dev Story. In it, you manage your own development studio, trying to release a string of popular video games without going bankrupt.
You design each game by combining a genre and a style (example: “Detective Racing”) and to make progress, you’ll have to make
a series of managerial decisions involving your studio’s staff. It’s a hilarious, if simplistic take on game development." - author in epilogue

"Art is never finished, it’s just abandoned"
   - Uncharted 4

"How do you convince fans that your game will be awesome without spoiling the best parts?"
   - Uncharted 4

      
“So many of the cultural problems both within the game industry and among fans come down to a lack of realistic public understanding
    of the tribulations of development. Jason opens a crucial door into an abnormally secretive industry, in the brave hope of
    teaching us a little more about its flammable alchemy.”
—Leigh Alexander, author and tech journalist  (in praise for the book)
