<!--
STRUCTURE
Intro - recently came across this book, I'm an SWE not a video game player, reflections on differences
"Miracle any game is made"
Why so hard - video games are at forefront of both art & tech
Stardew Valley -- made by solo developer
Diablo III -- recovery after disaster
mention other games
Conclusion - tip of iceberg, not possible without sacrifice
-->

<!--

NOTES
-----

Pillars of Eternity -- (I think) first successful Kickstarter
    can tie Kickstarter to crowd funded fantasy novels of Brandon Sanderson
Stardew Valley -- made by one man!!!
Diablo III -- Recovery after disaster
Shovel Knight -- Kickstarter (not the first but stil a lot of challenges), self employed (first game)

"It’s a miracle that any game is made." - annonymous developer, in an interview to author, in book intro

" Video games straddle the border between art and technology in a way that was barely possible just a few decades ago." - author in intro

" One surefire way to annoy a game developer is to ask, in response to discovering his or her chosen career path, what it’s like to spend all day playing video games." - author in intro

"You might not tell your friends how excruciating the process was." - author in epilogue
    (i.e., People only see the tip of the iceberg and think game development is easy)

"Is there a way to make great video games without that sort of sacrifice? Is it possible to develop a game without putting in endless hours? Will there ever be a reliable formula for making games that allows for more predictable schedules?
         
For many industry observers, the answers to those questions are: no, no, and probably not."
   - author in epilogue

"In 2010, a Japanese company called Kairosoft released a mobile phone game called Game Dev Story. In it, you manage your own development studio, trying to release a string of popular video games without going bankrupt.
You design each game by combining a genre and a style (example: “Detective Racing”) and to make progress, you’ll have to make
a series of managerial decisions involving your studio’s staff. It’s a hilarious, if simplistic take on game development." - author in epilogue

"Art is never finished, it’s just abandoned"
   - Uncharted 4

"How do you convince fans that your game will be awesome without spoiling the best parts?"
   - Uncharted 4

      
“So many of the cultural problems both within the game industry and among fans come down to a lack of realistic public understanding
    of the tribulations of development. Jason opens a crucial door into an abnormally secretive industry, in the brave hope of
    teaching us a little more about its flammable alchemy.”
—Leigh Alexander, author and tech journalist  (in praise for the book)
