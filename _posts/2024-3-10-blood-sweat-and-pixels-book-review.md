Normally I'm quite far from the world of video games. I consider myself a nerd, but unlike most nerds, I was never a big fan of playing video games. When I was a teenager, I had a couple of video games like Counter Strike and Dirt (car racing) in my PC - but they lay unused most of the time, only to be played when my younger cousin brothers came to my house on festivals. 

I have, however, always been more interested in the *process* of how video games are made. Although I haven't made any video game yet, I have tried to once when I was in school but ended up abandoning it.
But still, I would like to make and release at least one video game some time in the future - as a Software Engineer, I at least have the skills for game development, if not design.

Once, when I visited (with friends) a Video Game Fair in Delhi (capital of India), I was very interested in the various sights, sounds and experiences of so many free games around me, various of which I tried - to this day I regret that I didn't get the chance to play a VR (Virtual Reality) game which had quite a long line.

But anyway, now to come to the main topic: a while ago, I came across the book "Blood, Sweat and Pixels", which is a very fascinating glimpse inside the world of video game development. I'm not a video game player, but I'm a Software Engineer, so I was able to relate to many of the development aspects & difficulties. Especially the grind and unrealistic deadlines was relatable for me, as I have also sometimes had to work with tight deadlines, although thankfully much less than was portrayed in this book about Video Games' development.

> It’s a miracle that any game is made.
An annonymous game developer said this to the author (Jason Schreier), during one of his interviews with various insiders to understand what video game development is like. According to the author, this sentiment is common amongst all the people who have ever successfully built & sold a video game. Behind the scenes, every great video game is filled with funding getting suddenly cut, delays upon delays, developers forced to sacrifice most of their time for the sake of the game, etc.

> One surefire way to annoy a game developer is to ask, in response to discovering his or her chosen career path, what it’s like to spend all day playing video games.
The above quote from the book's introduction also perfectly summarizes the gap between what the general public thinks and the reality of video game development. From the surface, the general public thinks that video game development must be an "easy" and "fun" job. It's certainly not easy (any successful video game developer will tell you that), and it's often not fun - especially when developers need to pull all-nighters for weeks or months at a time to get the game released. As I mentioned, I'm not a video game developer, but I can certainly relate to non-technical friends and family thinking software development is "easy" that "anyone can do".

But still, why do video game developers need to sacrifice so much of their personal time - why is video game development unique?? After all, software development is done in many other industries also, and while there are some delays, delays in video games are usually so huge that they are incomparable. The author suggests an answer to this quandary: **"Video games straddle the border between art and technology in a way that was barely possible just a few decades ago."** Considering that video game developers work at the forefront of both art (pushing the boundaries of interactivity with the player) and high perfomance software development (video games are resource intensive, so even sub-second performance improvements can improve players' perception of the game).

### Stardew Valley

In the book, the author talks about how many famous video games were developed. For me, one of the most memorable games I read in this book was *Stardew Valley* - because it was **made full time by a solo developer Eric Barone!** To get an idea of how amazing this feat is, consider the fact that modern video games are typically developed by the effort of dozens (if not hundreds or even thousands) of people. Eric was largely inspired by the RPG game Harvest Moon (now known as Story of Seasons), which he used to play earlier and now set out to re-create its charm. He initially set the target of finishing his game in six months - a target which turned out to be far too optimistic.

Eric's wife Amber Hageman supported him in his efforts. Eric was working on Stardew Valley full time, so his wife Amber had to earn enough to support both of them. But Eric's initial target of six months kept growing - first by a few months, then a year, then 2 years. The main reason for this was **feature creep** - since there was nobody to hold Eric to a schedule, Eric kept putting everything he thought of in the game. Hageman and other family members started regularly asking Barone when Stardew Valley would be done. Finally after almost five years of working on the game round-the-clock with very few breaks, Eric released his game to the public on February 26, 2016. *The game proved to be a hit - in the next six months, 1.5 million copies of Stardew Valley had sold, earning Eric and his wife Amber close to 21 million dollars.*

Eric still kept working on his game fixing bugs, and finally took help from *Chucklefish* (a company that helped Eric launch his game), who assigned programmers to work on multi-media mode and other features.

<!--
Eric kept working on Stardew Valley - fans kept filing bug reports, and Eric pulled a lot of all-nighters fixing bugs (but inadvertently triggering new bugs). Many game publishers, including Microsoft and Nvidia, approached Eric to partner with them. Eric kept working on his game - until he couldn't do it any more. One morning, halfway through 2016, Eric Barone suddenly stopped working, and finally took his long overdue break in the form of a sabbatical over the summer.

### Diablo III

> After a decade of turbulent development, Diablo III had finally gone live, but nobody could play it. Some people gave up and went to bed. Others kept trying. An hour later:
> The servers are busy at this time. Please try again later. (Error 37)
> “Error 37” turned into a meme

On May 15, 2012, when Blizzard (game development studio) much awaited game Diablo III finally launched, the developers thought their days of grinding on the game were finally over - but instead their troubles had just started. Hundreds of thousands of gamers saw "Error 37" when they tried to play this game that was only available online.

Diablo III had made a lot of decisions that gamers disliked - for instance, making the game only available online, with no offline mode. "Error 37" was not the game's only issue - it was just the tip of the iceberg. It had some other fundamental issues - eg. difficulty ramped up way too fast, legendary items dropped very infrequently - but its most controversial feature was that its loot system centered around an in-game auction house, where players could buy & sell powerful equipment with real-life money. Critics said this loot system made the game feel like "pay-to-win".

In the coming months, Blizzard applied many patches and hotfixes to the game - but they knew these were just bandages over the real issues. Despite its disastrous beginning, Diablo III had sold an astounding ten million copies by July 2012. But Blizzard knew they could make an even better game, and made significant changes. Josh Mosqueira was appointed the new director in charge of the game. Josh made several decisions that other designers on the team disagreed with - for example, in the console version of the game, he introduced  “evade” feature that would allow players to use a joystick to roll around on the ground, dodging enemies’ attacks. The team introduced "Loot 2.0" - to prevent "loot overdose", theydecided to just drop gold as loot 70% of the time, they skewed randomness so that legendary loot items dropping would be actually useful to the player. In response to player complaints, they completely redid the difficulty system, a radical departure from the traditional difficulty system of the Diablo series. But one of the most impactful decisions the team made was to drop the controversial "pay-to-win" in-game auction house and instead gave other ways to access the most powerful equipment.

Finally on March 25, 2014, *Reaper of Souls* launched - an extension pack to Diablo III. This time Blizzard had made sure to strengthen their infrastructure so that there was no repeat of "Error 37". 
It was this extension pack that finally made the players love Diablo III - today when gamers are nostalgic about Diablo III, they aren't thinking of the original buggy release but of the much improved game after the extension pack was released. Diablo III is an incredible story of reslience and bouncing back after a rocky start by actually listening to your users (players).

### Conclusion

> Is there a way to make great video games without that sort of sacrifice? Is it possible to develop a game without putting in endless hours? Will there ever be a reliable formula for making games that allows for more predictable schedules?
> For many industry observers, the answers to those questions are: no, no, and probably not.

This quote from the book's epilogue perfectly sums up this dive into the development of video games. Video game development is unique in many ways because it pushes the boundary of what's possible in terms of both interactive art and high-performance software. I summarised the incredible stories of *Stardew Valley* and *Diablo III* above because I personally found them the most memorable. However the book also tells the stories of many other games - for example, *Pillars of Eternity* and *Shovel Knight*, both of which became successful through crowdfunding via Kickstarter (though their journeys were still quite different!), *Halo Wars*, a game whose development involved lots of conflict between Ensemble (the game studio) and Microsoft (the publisher) and ended up being the last ever game made by Ensemble, *Uncharted 4*, a game where the designers made the difficult decision to wrap up the story of the popular character 
Nathan Drake. There are many more such stories of how popular video games were developed behind the scenes - I encourage everyone to read the book [Blood, Sweat, and Pixels](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34376766-blood-sweat-and-pixels) to explore the stories of these and many other games' development behind the scenes.

In the end, I'll conclude with the quote below from the book's epilogue, about a game that attempts to show people how video games are actually made:

> In 2010, a Japanese company called Kairosoft released a mobile phone game called Game Dev Story. In it, you manage your own development studio, trying to release a string of popular video games without going bankrupt.
> You design each game by combining a genre and a style (example: “Detective Racing”) and to make progress, you’ll have to make a series of managerial decisions involving your studio’s staff. It’s a hilarious, if simplistic take on game development.

mention other games
Conclusion - tip of iceberg, not possible without sacrifice, I'm an SWE not a video game player, reflections on differences

NOTES
-----

Pragati Maidan -- Video Game Fair

Pillars of Eternity -- (I think) first successful Kickstarter
    can tie Kickstarter to crowd funded fantasy novels of Brandon Sanderson
Stardew Valley -- made by one man!!!
Diablo III -- Recovery after disaster
Shovel Knight -- Kickstarter (not the first but stil a lot of challenges), self employed (first game)

“So many of the cultural problems both within the game industry and among fans come down to a lack of realistic public understanding
    of the tribulations of development. Jason opens a crucial door into an abnormally secretive industry, in the brave hope of
    teaching us a little more about its flammable alchemy.”
—Leigh Alexander, author and tech journalist  (in praise for the book)
